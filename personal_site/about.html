            <h2 id = 'painting'>If you could say it in words, there would be no reason to paint - Edward Hopper.</h2>

            <p>I recently set out to grow my creativity on the painter's canvas 
                but my artistic ability can be summed up in one rigid term: <i>recreation</i>.  What I 
                see, I can muster out a decent copy.  As I've spent most of my life with a pencil 
                and paper, I am most comfortable with black and white sketches.  You can see in my 
                first couple of pieces I stuck with my comfort zone limiting my color spectrum in recreating 
                portraits consistent with a theme I obsessed over at the time: villains.

            <p>After getting comfortable, I decided to try to capture the spirit of adventure in an <b>original</b> triple-canvas 
                piece that challenged both my limits of <i>recreation</i> and my aversion to a more advanced 
                application of color.  Blending the sunset sky into the starry beyond proved a frustrating, yet,
                in hindsight, rewarding experience.

            <p>Looking forward, as I've recently been having fun learning about marine life, I hope to continue 
                to capture the spirit of adventure in a more ocean-themed direction.  Monterey Bay Aquarium, anyone?

        <h2 id = 'music'> A painter paints pictures on canvas, but musicians paint their pictures on silence - Leopold Stokowski.</h2>
            <p>Like my painting/sketching experience, my initial exposure to music was limited. The classical radio
                channel that my dad lived by was the well that my musical taste was born into.  When I finally got bored 
                one day and happened across a Bay Area Hip-Hop and R&B radio station, I instantly fell deeply in love 
                with Blues and Soul music.  I was enamored by how musicians, regardless of instrument, can bring a life 
                into music unexplainable by words.  I marveled at musicians who could 'freestyle' and produce a sound so 
                unique and warm seemingly out of thin air.  At some point, I enjoyed a freestyle session so much I transcribed 
                it note for note and dared to put my <i>recreation</i> of it onto social media: 
            </p>

            <p>As much as I appreciated the smooth, sweet molasses that flowed out of my radio, I myself was no John
                Legend.  Throughout the years since then, I've sought to grow in my vocal prowess by serving in my 
                worship team at church, and even at one point taking vocal lessons in the summer.  As I continually gain a 
                firmer grasp on the basics of singing, I really hope to start exploring ways to foster creativity in music as 
                I have began on the canvas.

        <h2 id = 'coding'>Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out - Chris Pine.</h2>
        <p>I'm convinced if I asked artists or musicians whether coding can be uttered with the same breath as their 
            respective trades, I'd get a few laughs... and to their credit, coding is no stroke of a brush. An introduction to
            coding presents a discipline that's rigid, confined to predefined functions and logic progressions and regular 
            expressions.  However, like any other discipline, as you build a decent coding foundation and explore more advanced topics
            a world of possibilities open up to you.  We see evidence of this in our daily lives: code runs through the very 
            appliances in our kitchens, the vehicles we drive, the tools we depend on at work.  Beyond necessity, code even 
            pervades our hobbies and comforts.  Throughout the years, I've dabbled in a few of the many avenues that a software 
            developer can build a career in and my efforts have not returned void.  I hope to eventually dive into the mysterious 
            world of machine learning as I expand my knowledge of coding.
